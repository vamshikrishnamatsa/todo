The frontend of the app is developed with React.js and TypeScript, ensuring a dynamic and type-safe user experience. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js, providing a robust API that handles all CRUD operations for task management. Task data is stored securely in MongoDB, allowing for persistent storage across sessions. The integration of these technologies ensures a seamless and efficient task management application that is both scalable and maintainable.
